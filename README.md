# Resting Countries
App for showing info about countries, that we get from external API.

# Running
Clone the repo, then:

`npm install`

`npm run start`
Now you'll have a running dev server with live reload enabled.

# TODO
- connect up filters
  - join text input box with the dropdown options
- use query parameter `fields` to API call to limit the amount of data we request
  - `https://restcountries.com/v2/{service}?fields={field},{field},{field}`
